# Karaoke Text Generator (and console output)

A tool to generate and display song lyrics in sync with audio directly in your terminal, with Docker support.

## Available Functions

### Song Management

- **`add_songs`**  
  Scans `.wav` files in the `audioLyrics/` folder and adds them to the `ungenerated_songs` list.  
  Next, call `generate_lyrics` to process these songs.

- **`generate_lyrics`**  
  Generates lyric timing JSON files stored in the `lyricFiles/` directory.  
  Currently supports **English songs only**. Accuracy may vary — manual review is recommended.

### Docker Commands

The docker image can be found at **`itzray/console-text-writer`**

```bash
docker run --rm -it itzray/console-text-writer list
```

- **`cmd_list_songs`**  
  Lists all available songs with their IDs for playback.

  ```bash
  docker run --rm -it console-text-writer list
  ```

  - **`cmd_play_song`**  
    Displays the lyrics in sync with audio for a selected song.

  ```bash

  ```

### Current Considerations and Future Expansion

- Add Lite and Complete edition docker images, lite will be the current version, complete will include the ai generation (currently omitted due to file size)
  - Turn the other functions into docker callable functions.
  - Allow a long running container that can accept .wav files and create local lyric files.
- Also play the audio file at the same time. Makes things easier to sync up.
- Add GUI version that opens file explorer for adding wav files.
  - Ensure Linux is also supported
- Add GUI text display
- Investigate using Youtube API, search for song or provide URL (May be best for MVP) and then automatically generate a .wav of the video.

### Note
I've kept some unnecessary files in here like the docker files just to act as a showcase of its existance (for employers).
