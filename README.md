### Current Considerations and Future Expansion

- Add Lite and Complete edition docker images, lite will be the current version, complete will include the ai generation (currently omitted due to file size)
  - Turn the other functions into docker callable functions.
  - Allow a long running container that can accept .wav files and create local lyric files.
- Also play the audio file at the same time. Makes things easier to sync up.
